# Task 4 Summary




Andrew : 
I focused on the percentage of state birth increase in the year of 1985, I found out there Arizona (State number 04) has the highest birth increase in that year.Also I noticed, in 1985 there is only 50 state number, there could be a data lost somewhere. Due to there is a state shows on bar chart had 0 birth increase. There could be a data lost. But since we have drop all the rows for Nah, there could be a mistake during data recording.

I focused on the total increased of US state population from 1985 to 2015 and I also compare the state births between each state from 1985 to 2015.  

Before everything, I've discovered that there is a data differentiation between pre-2003 and post-2003. For example, state 5 in pre-2003 dataset form a trend that matches state 6 in post-2003 dataset. Many of there treand anomolies occured so therefore I wrote a function called 'get_real_state' in the 'project_funciton.py' to obtain the original state match again. 

In the graph of State birth, we can see that the highest birth count occur in state 5 which is California if we count it in alphabetical order. I produced 4 scatterplots to plot all 51 states because each scatterplot can only account data for 20 states. Some of the state birth count are stopped after 2003 because the lack of data base on the scatterplot. For those state that we're able to see full scatterplot, we see that there's a trend with all those data.




Darren:

Darren's research question was how the US new births trended from 1985-2015 and how the new births compared in each month over the 30 years.
Â 
In the graph of total US population change, compare to other time periods, we found a significant decrease in the births between 1989 and 2002, a time period that we did not believe should be fluctuating in the US birth population, and after group discussion we thought that there may be missing data in the raw source. Alternatively, because our data sources were downloaded from the National Bureau for Economic Research for 1985-2012 and the CDC's Wonder tool for 2003-2015, it is another reason that the different sources may have contributed to the error.






Conclusion:
