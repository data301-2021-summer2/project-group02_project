We have worked to examine the new population in the United States over the three decades from 1985 to 2015, over time and by state: firstly, our first two graphs show the percentage change in births in each state before and after the three decades, to help us understand a general trend. The next two graphs show the comparison of births by month and the change in population curves and trends for each of the three decades, which can help us to understand and predict the distribution of births in the US by month and the number of new births in the future. In the final part, after correcting out anomalous data, we present the demographics of each US state using variables to determine the highest number of births for each year from 1985-2015 and use scatter plots to arrive at state #05 (California) as the state with the highest average number of new births. To conclude, our dataset contains a small variety of data, we have done our best to produce various visualizations and from these we have analyzed trends in the total number of new births in the US, the percentage of new births in each of the 56 states, a comparison of new births in all months, the highest birth states in each year and the states with the highest average increase.
