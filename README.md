## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
Our topic will be investigating growth in new population or new children born in different counties. We can use variables to present the population demographic of USA counties and determine the highest count of birth from 1975-2015 for each year. Also we will determine which country has increase most population in the period of 1985-2015. We may also use math model to further explore the relationship of different variables(GDP, baby boomer's age, etc) versus birth rates. This dataset can easily build a user-facing Dashboard as it is very easy to be manipulated and present graphically!
